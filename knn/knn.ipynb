    "1. Modify the `label_counts` function to return a dictionary of frequencies corresponding to each label in the training set. \n",
    "1. Modify the `majority` function so that it returns the _label_ that appears most frequently in the $K$-nearest neighbors of the query point.  In the case that the maximum frequency occurs for two or more labels, return the one that appears most frequently in the entire training set. In the case that there is still a tie, break the tie in any way that you choose. \n",
    "1. Modify the `classify` function so that it finds the _indices_ of the $K$ closest training examples to the query point and then calls the `majority` function to return the predicted label. Almost all of the heavy lifting here will be done by the BallTree object from `sklearn.neighbors`, so you'll want to start out by reading the [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.BallTree.html).  \n",

    "We've given you unit tests down below based on the simple example worked out in lecture.  At first your code will fail all of them.  Do not move on to **Problem 3** until your code passes all of the unit tests. In addition, passing the unit tests does not guarantee that your implementation is robust and that you'll earn full points on this problem.  You should be designing your own additional tests as well.
